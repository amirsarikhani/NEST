# NEST
The Nexus Solutions Tool (NEST) is a new open modeling platform that integrates multi-scale energy-water-land resource optimization with distributed hydrological modeling. This approach provides insights into the vulnerability of water, energy and land resources to future socioeconomic and climatic change and how multi-sectoral policies, technological solutions and investments can improve the resilience and sustainability of transformation pathways.
