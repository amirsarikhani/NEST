## Scripts for figures

Some Figures in [Vinca et al. (2019)](https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-2019-134) show data analysis or results.
Here are listed the script used to generate them (some further edit done on image eidting softwares are not reproducible just running the scripts)

- In the `Community_Water_Model` Folder it is possible to find several scripts used for check the model calibration (as Fig. 6)
- Figure 7 _a_ and _b_ are generated running the `MESSAGEix/basin_msggdx_diagnostics.r` file
- Figure 8 is generated in the `large_figure.r` script
- Figure 9 and 10 are generated in `dedicated_plots_baseline_SDG.r`
